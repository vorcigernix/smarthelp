Is recording visitors legal?
Yes. Tracking behavior and movement of your visitors using Smartsupp is legal, just like using Google Analytics or other services for tracking visitors on your website.
From a legal point of view it’s important if you record personal data of visitors using Smartsupp. This is something you can set up in Smartsupp. On most websites the only place where visitors might fill in personal data are forms. To ensure Smartsupp doesn't record any personal data, simply disable recording of form inputs in Smartsupp settings.
If you have recording of forms inputs enabled in Smartsupp, you are most likely collecting personal data of your visitors. Collecting of personal data is subject to local laws in your country. In most countries in European Union you are required to inform visitors of your website about the fact you collect their personal data through a 3rd party software. We recommend to add the following statement to your terms & conditions or privacy policy: “Your personal data might be collected by us or 3rd parties, such as Smartsupp.com, s.r.o., VAT ID CZ03668681”.
Legal requirements about personal data collection may vary across countries in the world. It's best to consult a local lawyer in your country if you are unsure about your legal obligations in this area.
Should I inform visitors that I record them?
It depends if you record personal data of your visitors using Smartsupp and also on local laws in your country. If you don’t record any personal data, you don’t need to inform your visitors about the recording. If you do record personal data of your visitors through Smartsupp, you are most likely required to inform them about this. Best way is to include it in your privacy policy that is easily accessible on your website. Please see the question above for more information.
Is visitor data safe with Smartsupp?
The data of your visitors is safe with Smartsupp. We created several security steps to protect the sensitive data of your visitors.
Access to the visitor recordings of your website is possible only after logging into your Smartsupp account. Your account can only be accessed using your login email and password. We recommend using a strong password that can't be guessed.
Smartsupp never records form fields marked as sensitive. This means passwords, credit card numbers and other sensitive data are not recorded, even if you do record form inputs. If Smartsupp is recording passwords or credit card numbers on your website, this most likely means your web developers didn't mark those form fields as sensitive when creating your website. In such a case please contact your web developer to set those form fields as sensitive in the code.
Smartsupp is using SSL / TLS encryption (Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security) and latest security standards to protect your data.
You can block any elements of your site from being recorded using our API.
For more information about our data security see our Privacy Policy.
