DO I NEED APPROVAL FROM MY CUSTOMERS WHEN I USE SMARTSUPP?
Smartsupp uses cookies. So it depends on how you use Smartsupp.
I only use a basic version of the chatbot without advanced features - you do not need consent here, as you are processing this data based on your legitimate interest to answer a customer's query and provide customer support.
I also use "smart" analytics and marketing features - you can't do without consent here. We recommend that you procure consent with a cookie bar where the user gives explicit consent to analytical and/or marketing cookies (e.g. Allow All).
HOW DO I EDIT MY PROCESSES IF I USE SMARTSUPP?

Cookies towards your customers:

The main purpose of this cookie is to identify visitors to your website. Based on this, we can pair the visitor with a conversation when the page is reloaded. As a result, the ongoing conversation does not disappear even after the page is reloaded, so visitors can continue where they left off.
This cookie therefore allows us to display the source, browser information, and number of visits that are listed in the visitor information in the Dashboard.
