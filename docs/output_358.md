Where to find Visitors?
In the Visitors tab, you can see all of the people who are currently browsing your website.
Warning: You might notice that there is a difference between the number of visitors on the desktop version and on the mobile app. This is because only active visitors are visible on the mobile app and inactive visitors are not displayed. This was done to optimize the speed of the mobile app.
Filters
You can use the search bar (1) to find a specific visitor, or filters (2) to display just the relevant visitors.

How to start a conversation with the visitor?
This feature is only available in STANDARD and PRO package.
If you want to start a chat conversation with your visitor (for example offer him a discount or just welcome him to your website), you can actively contact him directly from the Visitor tab in your Dashboard. Just click on a specific visitor on your website and choose Open conversation. Then you'll be able to send a message to your visitor.
Tip: If you want to effectively reach out to your visitors, we recommend using Automatic messages or Chatbots which will do the work for you!
Still confused? Contact us via the chat box in your dashboard and we’ll be happy to get in touch with you. Please note that customer service is included only in paid packages.
