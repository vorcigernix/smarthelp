Desktop notifications are visual notifications on your screen that alert you to incoming messages from visitors in Smartsupp chat. Desktop notification is shown even if you are browsing a different tab or you have opened another app, e.g. Microsoft Word. This way, you avoid missed conversations on your website. After you click on the desktop notification, chat with the visitor is opened in Smartsupp dashboard.
Desktop notifications are usually shown in the bottom right corner of your screen:
In Safari browser, desktop notifications appear in the top right corner:
The way to set up desktop notifications is slightly different in each browser. Here you will find easy tutorials on how to allow notifications in most commonly used web browsers: Mozilla Firefox, Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Safari.
Note: Desktop notification settings are dependent on your web browser, so the time after which the notification disappears also depends on which web browser you are using. It can also be changed with browser updates. We recommend to use Google Chrome who we think has the most visible desktop notifications.
