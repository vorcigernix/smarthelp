We take site performance very seriously and constantly optimize our script to improve load time. We also use various tools and services like CDN (content delivery network) to load our script super fast everywhere around the globe.
Page speed measuring tools don't always give an accurate picture when analyzing scripts like Smartsupp. You can often see the same issues with Google Analytics script. Smartsupp script loads asynchronously, meaning it doesn't prevent the rest of your website from loading while it downloads. Warnings you see in various page speed tools don't mean our script slows down your site. The load time of our script is negligible on most websites.
