Statistics are only available in STANDARD and PRO packages. Only full-access agents and owner of the account are able to see Statistics.
Statistics are a useful feature if you want to monitor and continuously improve your customer service. If you are a manager, you can set goals for your agents, and check if they manage to meet them. Statistics also help you to identify specific areas where your employees can improve so you can help them to make progress.
Where to find Statistics?
Open your dashboard and click on the tab with the image of a chart. Only the owner of the account and full-access agents can see this tab.
If you use the feature Groups, you can pick a group in the upper right corner of the page and obtain data about a specific team
Conversations statistics
All conversations statistics can be found in the first section.
1. New conversations
In this tab, you'll find a chart that shows the number of new conversations during a selected period of time. You can set the time period in the upper right corner of the page.
2. Conversations replied to
In this tab, you'll find a chart that shows the number of conversations to which your agents replied during a selected period of time. You can set the time period in the upper right corner of the page.
3. Closed conversations
In this tab, you'll find a chart that shows the number of resolved conversations during a selected period of time. You can set the time period in the upper right corner of the page.
4. Average rating
This feature helps you to find out how your customers evaluate your agents’ performance.
On the left, you can see the overall average rating as well as how many positive, negative and neutral reviews you’ve received. To calculate the average rating, we use the arithmetic mean.
In the upper right corner of the graph, there are set options of time periods you can select to customize the graph. This way you can easily find out when your customers tend to leave better reviews and if their satisfaction changes depending on whether is low or high season (for example before Christmas).
5. Response time
Would you like to know, how long does it take for your agents to reply on the live chat? Now you can see all your agents’ response times in one graph. To calculate the response time we use the median.
The lower the response time, the better the performance. You can achieve a lower response time by using shortcuts and by communicating effectively with your customers. However, response time also includes the time it takes to answer your customers’ questions via email. That’s why sometimes your response time can be up to several hours or even days.
Agents statistics
If you are interested in how specific agents are doing, you will find all the information you need in this section.
Summary
This feature is only available in the PRO package.
Here you will find an overview of statistics for all agents in your account. If you have agents divided into groups, you can filter the statistics according to the selected group.
Online time
This last graph tells you when exactly you were online (which means that at least one of your agents was active). It helps you to keep track of your agents’ performance and to monitor their activity during the day.
If you use the feature Group, you can pick a specific group In the right upper corner of the page to see the online time of individual agents from a selected team.
If you are a manager, this feature can help you to analyze and improve your team's productivity and efficiency, especially if your agents work remotely.
Tags statistics
In the last section of statistics, you will find an overview of the tag's usage. What information you can find in these statistics is explained in this tutorial.
What's the median and how to work with it?
The median is the middle score for a set of data that has been arranged in order of magnitude. The median is less affected by outliers and skewed data. That is why we are using it to calculate response times, and chat duration for Smartsupp statistics.
Calculation
These are the 1st response times of one agent. The median is calculated as the “middle” value from data that has been arranged in order of magnitude. In this case, the median is 18 seconds (the fifth largest, and also the fifth smallest number in this data set).
