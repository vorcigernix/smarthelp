How do automatic messages work?
Automatic messages together with Chatbots allow you to talk to each visitor on your website as if you were right there next to them.
An automatic message is sent to your website’s visitors when specific conditions are met. For example, you can send an automatic message to a visitor that views a specific item in your e-shop for longer than three minutes. The message could be something along the lines of “Hi there, I see you’ve been checking out our brand-new Canon camera. Can I help you with any questions?” To the visitor, it appears as if a live agent is proactively messaging them.
Where to find automatic messages?
If you want to add or activate an automatic message, just click on the Robot icon (1) in your Dashboard and choose Auto messages (2).
Preset automatic messages
In Smartsupp, there are six preset automatic messages that cover the majority of the most common situations. You can find them after clicking on the button +Add new in the upper right corner and scrolling down to the Automatic messages section. These preset messages work for specific scenarios and have conditions that work best for these given situations, so if you don't have time to create your own, just use these messages exactly as they are.

However, we’ve collected a few tips on how to engage your visitors via automatic messages.

Conditions settings
Do you need to trigger your automatic messages on a specific website? At a specific moment? Or display it only to a specific audience? Set up the conditions and reach a specific audience at the right moment without any manual intervention.
Conditions for Automatic messages work the same way as the Chatbot conditions. To get more information about how they work or how to set them up, check the Chatbot conditions tutorial.
Note: In some accounts created before June 8, 2021, there are still available old automatic messages, which will be soon moved to the new interface. They are all displayed directly under the new automatic messages section in the Chatbot tab where they can be enabled, disabled, or edited. You can find more information about old automatic messages settings here.
Statistics
In case you want to know, how many times the auto messages were triggered on your website and how many visitors contacted you after receiving the auto message, you can check it in the Summary section available directly in the auto messages tab.
