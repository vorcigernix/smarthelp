Do you need to trigger your chatbot on a specific website? At a specific moment? Or display it only to a specific audience? Set up chatbot conditions and reach a specific audience at the right moment without any manual intervention.
Below we'll show you how to specify the conditions to trigger the chatbot exactly according to your needs.
How can I set up and manage chatbot conditions?
First, open the Chatbot tab by clicking on the robot icon (1) and selecting Chatbots (2). Then select the bot that you'd like to modify. 
Then click on "Settings" at the top of the page. 
There you’ll see an overview of all the conditions that you can add to your chatbot. Would you like to hear a bit more? Below, we’ll show you how to step-by-step set up and manage individual conditions. 
How to set up when the chatbot will be triggered?
Do you need to trigger a chatbot at a specific moment? For example, when a visitor sends you a message or after they spend a specific time on your website? Here’s how to do it: 
Click on the first tab "When" and choose one of the 5 preset options (triggers) that best fits your needs (1):
After a visitor stays on the website
After a visitor stays on a particular subpage
After a visitor clicks on the chat box button
After a visitor sends a message
After a visitor sends a message but doesn't receive a reply
After a visitor hasn’t replied to previous automated response
Then, choose how much time has to pass until the chatbot is started (2).
If you don't make any changes, the chatbot will be triggered by default after a visitor lands on the website.
How to set up where the chatbot will be triggered?
Do you need to display the chatbot only on specific pages of your website? Below, you can see how to set it up: 
Click on the second tab ‘Where’. Choose one of the 2 preset options that best fits your needs.
On all pages (1) - chatbot will be triggered on all pages of your website 
On specific pages (2) - chatbot will be triggered only on specific pages that you insert in the text field. Triggers: URL or Title is/is not/containing/not _. 
You can also launch a chatbot using the title of the web page that the visitor is currently browsing. What exactly is that? In this context, TITLE is an HTML element that defines the document's title that is shown in a browser's title bar or a page's tab. Just click on the button '+Add condition' and then choose the option 'Title'.
Please note that the chatbot will be triggered only if all conditions are met.
Note: If you select the option "is/isn't", the chatbot will be/won't be triggered only on a specific URL address of your choice. If you select the option "containing/not containing", the chatbot will be/won't be triggered on all the pages that contain the URL string of your choice - e. g. www.eshop.com/products.
In case you need to add more URL or TITLE conditions, you can choose if 'All' of them should be met (the relationship between the conditions is 'AND') or 'At least one' of them should be met (the relationship between the conditions is 'OR')
Note: If you set up two URL conditions with AND, the chatbot won't be displayed correctly. It is necessary to change the condition to OR option or erase one URL condition.
Don’t forget to save your changes before leaving. 
If you don't make any changes, the chatbot will be triggered by default on all pages.
How to set up to whom the chatbot will be triggered?
If you need to display the chatbot only to a specific audience for example only to visitors who landed on your website for the first time, this condition will come in quite handy. 
Click on the third tab ‘Audience’. Choose one of the 3 preset options that best fits your needs (1).
All visitors - chatbot is displayed to all visitors that land on your website
New visitors - chatbot is displayed only to visitors that land on your website for the first time 
Returning visitors - chatbot is displayed only to visitors that have already landed on your website before
You can also choose on which device the chatbot should be displayed (2)
Desktop
Mobile
Both
You can also add the IP address, City, Country code, Group, Referer, Number of chats, Browser, or Operating system condition (3). 
Note: When you set up these conditions you can also select between options "is/isn't" and "containing/not containing" and you can also decide if the chatbot should be launched when 'All' conditions are met or just 'At least one' of them is met as in Where settings. 
Don’t forget to save your changes before leaving. 
If you don't make any changes, the chatbot will be triggered by default to all visitors.
How to set up a chatbot to be triggered according to the chat box status?
Do you need to show the chatbot only if you’re offline for example to inform your visitors that you’ll get back to them soon? Or would you prefer to have the chatbot triggered only when you’re online? 
Click on the tab ‘Scheduling’. Choose options that best fit your needs. 
Chat box status (1)
Online - chatbot is displayed if the status of your chat box is online
Offline - chatbot is displayed if the status of your chat box is offline 
Any - chatbot is displayed in both cases 
Month (2), Day (3), and Time (4)
Don’t forget to save your changes before leaving. 
If you don't make any changes, the chatbot will be triggered by default in both cases.
How to set up a behavior - (not) sending messages via chatbot?
Click on the tab ‘Behavior’.
You can decide if you want to trigger a chatbot for visitors who have already received a previous automated response (1).
Also, If you don't have time to be online and answer your customer's questions, however, you want to provide good customer care via chatbot, you can set up the chatbot containing all useful information for your visitors and turn off the text field, so the customers won't be able to send you a message via chat box (2).
Tip: You can also combine this feature with the transfer to an agent feature. Thanks to that you'll be able to filter the customer's questions via chatbot more easily, however, they will still have the option to reach you.
Don’t forget to save your changes before leaving.
