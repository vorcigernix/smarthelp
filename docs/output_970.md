If your webshop runs on Shoptet, connecting your online store to Smartsupp is super easy and quick. Just follow the short tutorial below and in a few minutes, everything will be set up and ready to use!
Install Smartsupp on your website
Warning: Currently, there are two Smartsupp addons available in Shoptet - Smartsupp and Smartsupp+. We are no longer developing the old Smartsupp addon and new features are not available there. Therefore, install the new Smartsupp+ addon, which we regularly update and develop new features for. 
In the Shoptet administration click on Connections (1) >> Addons Manager (2) and then Go to Shoptet Addons (3)
Search for the Smartsupp+ and install it. Then open the addon settings and create a new Smartsupp account or sign in to an already existing one.
If you already have an account and are logged in, you will see this page.
Note: Activation of the multilingual chat box is possible. It is necessary to add the API in the administration via the left column → Appearance and content → Editor → tab HTML code → address/admin/html-kody/. 
The API needs to be added ideally in the second field "Footer" (before the end tag "BODY").
If this doesn't work, try putting the API in the "Header" (before the end "HEAD" tag).
Activation of a new addon
Currently, there are two Smartsupp addons available in Shoptet - Smartsupp and Smartsupp+. We are no longer developing the old Smartsupp addon and new features are not available there. Therefore, install the new Smartsupp+ addon, which we regularly update and develop new features for. 
In case you are already using the integration via the old addon, first, disable the old addon (click on the Disconnect Smartsupp account button), then in the Shoptet dashboard click on Connections >> Addons Manager and then Go to Shoptet Addons, where you can find the new Smartsupp+ addon and install it. After this open the addon settings and log in with your Smartsupp account. Detailed instructions with screenshots can be found at the first point of this tutorial. 
How to disconnect the account?
If you no longer want to use Smartsupp on your website or you need to deactivate the integration for a while, just click on "Disconnect Smartsupp account" in the Smartsup+ tab in Shoptet.
