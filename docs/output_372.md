Smartsupp will only appear on the listed domain. If you leave the field empty, then Smartsupp chat can be added to any domain.
If you decided to use domain whitelist, please make sure that you’ve entered your domain(s) in a correct way. Do not use capital letters, protocol or path, only domains.
Correct listing:
www.website.com
website.com

Incorrect listing (do not use!, will be automatically corrected):
http://www.website.com
https://www.website.com
www.website.com/example
*.website.com
