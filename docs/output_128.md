In case you are trying to log in to the dashboard, and you can only see a blank page, it may be necessary to check your security settings (e.g. Firewall) and whitelist all of our domains (ideally send this list to your IT department):

smartsuppchat.com
smartsuppcdn.com
You should find out which domain exactly is causing the issues by opening the Chrome console (you can do that by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+J in Chrome).
