We are the company Smartsupp.com, s.r.o., VAT ID: CZ03668681 and we operate the website www.smartsupp.com. We use cookies, which may be personal data, to ensure the functioning of this website, improve its functions, or better target advertising.
Below you can read what cookies are, what they are for and how they are used. If you want to know how we process personal data, see our Privacy Policy.
What are cookies?
Cookies are small data files that are stored on your computer or phone when you visit a website or use some online service.
What is it used for?
Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our website and services to function at all. They are therefore referred to as "necessary". By law, we do not need your consent for these cookies and we process them based on the so-called legitimate interest.
Example: Verifying that you are really human, displaying the website correctly or displaying the cookie bar. They therefore help ensure the basic functions of the website and its security.
Other cookies allow the website to remember information about your settings. We call them "preferential".
Example: Remembering that you have chosen English as your preferred language on bilingual websites. These cookies remember your settings and the page will always be displayed in your preferred language.
Other cookies help us collect information about the use of the website, such as the number of visitors, or the time you spend on individual parts of the website. As their purpose suggests, these cookies are called "statistical".
Example: The number of website visitors, unused bookmarks and unread articles, the number of people who do not complete an order due to a too complicated purchase process and many other statistics that help us and you create a better experience on our website.
Last but not least, cookies can serve to enable us to show you relevant advertisements, including on other websites or social networks. We refer to these cookies as "marketing".
Example: Viewing an ad for our services on another website, a promoted post on Facebook, but also viewing a YouTube video on our website. They help show you ads that are relevant to you.
You can find a list of the individual cookies we use, including their individual names, provider, purpose, type and expiration and the possibility to change your settings here.
Since we use some of these providers, such as Google, Facebook, etc., not only in connection with cookies, we provide summary information about them in our Privacy Policy.
