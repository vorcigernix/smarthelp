Insert code
Go to Pages, edit page you want and below content in Scripts n Styles insert modified code.
Click Update Scripts and Update your page.
Smartsupp cannot be installed on WordPress.com
The chat code cannot be installed on a free hosted WordPress.com website due to the fact that custom plugins cannot be installed on the platform. In addition, custom JavaScript is blocked from being embedded within these types of sites.
Note: If you are using a Google account to log into Smartsupp, it won't be possible to log in to the WordPress plugin the same way.
You can either insert the chat code manually, or you can click on "forgotten password" in Smartsupp and set up your login via email.
